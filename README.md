# MediAI - Your Own Doctor

MediAI is a revolutionary healthcare application that harnesses the power of machine learning models to provide predictive analysis, connect patients with doctors, and enable self-diagnosis recommendations. This repository contains code for machine learning models implemented in Jupyter notebooks, as well as the Django web application for exploratory data analysis and prediction.

## Machine Learning Models

In the Jupyter notebooks provided, you can find various machine learning models implemented for predictive analysis in healthcare. These models include but are not limited to:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks

To run the notebooks, follow these steps:

1. Open Jupyter Notebook.
2. Select the desired kernel for your notebook.
3. Run the notebook to train and evaluate the machine learning models.

## Running the Django App

To run the Django web application for exploratory data analysis and prediction, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Django installed in your Python environment.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run the following command to start the Django development server: python manage.py runserver
4. Access the web application through your browser at the specified address (usually http://127.0.0.1:8000/).

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The Django app includes features for exploratory data analysis, including visualization of medical data through interactive graphs. This allows users to gain insights into the provided data.

## Predictive Analysis in Healthcare

Predictive analysis in healthcare is crucial for early detection and intervention in medical conditions. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, MediAI aims to predict health outcomes, recommend early medication, and facilitate doctor appointments for patients.

## Business Model

MediAI operates on a subscription-based model, offering various features to users:

- **Predictive Analysis:** Providing predictions for health conditions based on historical data and symptoms.
- **Connect with Doctors:** Facilitating appointments and communication between patients and healthcare providers.
- **Self-Diagnosis Recommendations:** Offering preliminary recommendations for self-diagnosis based on symptoms and medical history.

### Estimated Costs (in Rupees)

- Basic Plan: ₹500/month
- Standard Plan: ₹1000/month
- Premium Plan: ₹2000/month

## Classification Problem

The predictive analysis component of MediAI addresses a classification problem, where the objective is to classify medical conditions based on input features such as symptoms, patient history, and demographic information.

## Conclusion

MediAI aims to revolutionize healthcare by integrating machine learning, predictive analysis, and patient-doctor connectivity. Through its innovative approach, it empowers individuals to take control of their health and make informed decisions.
